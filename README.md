## Conclusion 
The progression of scans, from A to D, in our vulnerability management lab experiment provides valuable insights into the dynamic nature of security assessment and remediation. Initially, Scan A revealed basic information without credentials, offering a limited understanding of potential vulnerabilities. With Scan B, where credentials were provided, we obtained a more comprehensive report, identifying critical vulnerabilities amidst the highs.
An intriguing aspect of our experimentation was the installation of an outdated version of Firefox, which accentuated the significance of software age in vulnerability assessment. This led to Scan C, our current scan, which unveiled a substantial increase in critical vulnerabilities, underscoring the importance of continuous monitoring and patching.
Following the necessary remediation efforts, Scan D demonstrated a remarkable reduction in vulnerabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of proactive security measures. This iterative process of scanning, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing remediation measures embodies the essence of vulnerability management.
Moreover, our exploration into experimenting with outdated software, such as Windows XP, underscores the need for comprehensive vulnerability testing across diverse environments. It emphasizes the importance of staying abreast of evolving security threats and implementing robust security practices.
In conclusion, vulnerability management encompasses more than just scanning and remediating; it involves establishing standards, policies, and procedures within organizations. Collaboration across departments and automation are crucial for efficient vulnerability management, especially in large organizations.
